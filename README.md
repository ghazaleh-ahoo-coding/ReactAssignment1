# React Assignment 1 - Reusable Component

This project demonstrates creating a simple reusable React component named `ProductCard` that accepts at least two props (`name` and `price`) and renders content based on them. The component is implemented as a functional component with clean, readable JSX and is reused multiple times in `App.jsx` with different props to showcase reusability. The repository contains a complete React project structure including `package.json`, the `src` folder with all components, and the `public` folder, following assignment rules for component naming, props usage, and functional component implementation. Each instance of the component can be styled independently and displays different data to prove reusability.
